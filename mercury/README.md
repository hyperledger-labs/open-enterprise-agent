# Mercury folder

We are following the directory structure defined in [RFC 0013 - Service-Oriented BB API Dependency Management](https://input-output.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ATB/pages/3534848001/RFC+0013+-+Service-Oriented+BB+API+Dependency+Management).

> Note: The API folder has been moved into the `mercury-mediator` folder which does not conform with the published RFC - however - this change is required to ensure the CI process detects commits related to API changes and publishes the runnable image containing the API spec. 

**Folders:**

- `mercury-library`:
  Is our project implementation of the DID Comm and DID Comm protocols.

- `mercury-cloud-agent`:
  An implementation of a DID Comm Agent on the cloud.

- `mercury-mediator`:
  Is our project implementation of the DID Comm mediator agent.

  See [Mercury Mediator](./mercury-mediator/Mercury-Mailbox-Mediator.md)

- `roots-id-mediator`:
  Contains a configuration setup and utilities script to test interoperability against ROOTS-ID's mediator.

  See [ROOTS-ID-mediator](./roots-id-mediator/REAMDE-ROOTS-ID-mediator.md)
