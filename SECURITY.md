# Reporting Security Issues

The Open Enterprise Agent (OEA) team and community take security bugs in the components of the OEA ecosystem seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/open-enterprise-agent/security/advisories/new) tab.

The OEA team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
